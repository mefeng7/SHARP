### Set up
# -------------------------------------------
## 1. file paths
dat_path<-"D:/Nest_Models/Data/"
#dat_path<-"/home/FCAM/mlfeng/Data/"
path_out<-"D:/Nest_Models/Outputs/"





## 2. parameters
# what prediction resolution?
reso<-30

# use random background points or veg plots as absences?
ab_type<-"v"
#ab_type<-"b" 

# pick which predictors and response to use for models
predictors <- "uvvr"
#predictors <- "no uvvr" #removes observations mising uvvr data


# veg class codes
veg_codes<-data.frame(veg_code=c(1:2,4:9),
                      veg_class=c("HIMARSH","LOMARSH","MUD","PHRG","POOL","STRM","TERRBRD","UPLND"))





## 3. Load observations with predictors
# list of predictor files for each zone as a raster stack
load(paste0(path_out,"predictor_files_all_zones_",reso,"m.rds"))

# point predictors
dat<-read.csv(paste0(path_out,"Final_outputs/SALS_nest_vars_local.csv"))%>%
  filter(bp%in%c("p",ab_type))%>%
  mutate(presence=ifelse(bp=="p",1,0))%>%
  left_join(veg_codes,by="veg_class")

# buffered predictors
dat<-read.csv(paste0(path_out,"Final_outputs/SALS_nest_vars_buff15.csv"))%>%
  dplyr::select(id,HIMARSH,LOMARSH,POOL,PHRG,STRM,MUD,TERRBRD)%>% #remove UPLND, keep phrag since directly management related
  right_join(dat,by="id")%>%
  mutate(veg_code=as.factor(veg_code),
         #create binary variables for each veg class
         Highmarsh=as.factor(ifelse(veg_class=="HIMARSH",1,0)))





### Filtering data
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. Remove nests that are in non-marsh habitat and contain no marsh in their buffer
table(dat$veg_class) # lots of nests in stream and upland classifications
             # remove if...
dat<-filter(dat, 
             # nest is in non-marsh
             !((veg_class%in%c("UPLND","STRM","PHRG","TERRBRD","MUD","POOL")) &
              # and nest buffer contains no vegetated marsh habitat
               ((HIMARSH!=0 & LOMARSH!=0) | (!is.na(HIMARSH)&!is.na(LOMARSH)))))

table(dat$presence)
#table(dat2$veg_class)

# remove rapid demo sites
#don't seem to be any (would be nest without site name)




## 5. Remove missing values from predictors
#data with all vegetation class and NAIP predictors
dat_comp<-dat[complete.cases(dat[ , c("veg_code","cor_txt")]),]
dat_comp[,c("HIMARSH","LOMARSH","PHRG","STRM","MUD","TERRBRD")]<-dat_comp[,c("HIMARSH","LOMARSH","PHRG","STRM","MUD","TERRBRD")]%>%
  replace(is.na(.),0)

#data with all predictors including UVVR
dat_comp_all<-dat_comp[complete.cases(dat_comp[ , c("uvvr_mean")]),]




## 6. pick which predictors to use for models

# don't use UVVR data (increases data availability)
if(predictors=="no uvvr"){
  pres_dat<-dat_comp
  surv_dat<-dat_comp[!is.na(dat_comp$fate),] #filter just the nests with known fates
}

# use UVVR data (limits data availability by more than half)
if(predictors=="uvvr"){
  pres_dat<-dat_comp_all
  surv_dat<-dat_comp_all[!is.na(dat_comp_all$fate),] #filter just the nests with known fates
}





## 7. Check for balance among sample groups 

# Remove Years with less than 5 observations
yr_n<-summarise(group_by(pres_dat,Year),count=n())
pres_dat<-filter(pres_dat,is.na(Year)|Year!=2010)

#remove sites with less than 5 observations
site_n<-summarise(group_by(pres_dat,site),count=n())

pres_dat<-filter(pres_dat,(is.na(site)|pres_dat$site %in% site_n[site_n$count>=5,]$site)|(is.na(Year)|pres_dat$Year%in% yr_n[yr_n$count>=5,]$Year))
surv_dat<-filter(surv_dat,(is.na(site)|surv_dat$site %in% site_n[site_n$count>=5,]$site)|(is.na(Year)|surv_dat$Year%in% yr_n[yr_n$count>=5,]$Year))


# Check Class Balance
# balancing can help machine learning models

#look at prevelance of nest fledge to nest fail
addmargins(table(dat$fate))
#663/1745 nest successes


dat%>%
  filter(!is.na(fate))%>%
  summarize(pr_success=sum(fate,na.rm=T)/n())
#nest success relative frequency for the whole dataset is 0.32 (32%)

success_site<-dat%>%group_by(site)%>%
  filter(!is.na(fate))%>%
  summarize(pr_success=sum(fate,na.rm=T)/n(),
            lat=mean(latitude,na.rm=T))

hist(success_site$pr_success, breaks=seq(0,1,0.1))
plot(success_site$pr_success~success_site$lat,xlab="Site latitude",ylab="Proportion of nests fledging")
#nest success appears to be more variable at higher latitudes
mean(success_site$pr_success)
#nest success across sites is also 32% on average



# Check sampling bias

# look at spatial distribution and temporal distribution
# does the data need thinning?
# best to thin the more prevalent class (nest fails to retain higher calibration) - thin to balance

# Are observers returning to locations where they previously saw nests?
# since we are using multi-year data, some nests might be frequently seen in similar locations
# might be good to thin some of these out
# How are observations distributed across marsh sites?

# Thin to balance nest failures (could have nests in nearly the same locations in different years, prioritize the successful nests at these locations)
