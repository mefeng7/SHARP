### Set up
# -------------------------------------------
source("05a_Set_Model_Parameters.R")


## Look for outliers in X and Y and check distributions
#-------------------------------------------------------------------

#outliers in...
#Predictors: Transformation is an option when you dont want to lose any data
#Response: choose a statistical method that uses a probability distribution that allows greater variation for large mean values
# Gamma for continuous or poisson/negative binomial for counts

#Diagnostic tools:
#Cooks statistic for linear regression (change in regression parameters as each observation is individually omitted)
#if there are multiple outliers with similar values, they wont be detected



#list all predictor variables in the full model
pres_preds<-pres_dat[,all_terms]
surv_preds<-surv_dat[,all_terms]

# can cause over dispersion in poisson glms
# when outcome is binary, outliers are better handled

#Boxplot, histogram, scatterplot are graphical tools for outlier detection

for(i in 1:(length(all_terms))){
  par(mfrow = c(1, 3),mar=c(5,4,7,2)) #bottom, left, top, right
  hist(pres_preds[,i], main = "Histogram")
  boxplot(pres_preds[,i], main = "Boxplot")
  qqnorm(pres_preds[,i], main = "Normal Q-Q plot")
  mtext(paste0(all_terms[i]), side = 3, line = - 2, outer = TRUE)
}


#leverage
#i_n <- influence(mod)$hat # calculate the influence of data points in the model
#train[which.max(i_n),]

#cooks distance
# R code
#c_d <- cooks.distance(mod)
#train[which.max(c_d),]


#NDVI - right skewed, 0 inflated, outliers on tail
#cor_ext- zero inflated, outliers on either side of zero (could be normal if not for zeros)
#Highmarsh - if the nest is in highmarsh habitat, pretty even divide, ~300 difference
#HIMARSH - proportion of high marsh in 15 meter buffer * maybe we could extend this buffer and look for upland land cover types. Is the nearest edge forest? or open?
#ent_txt, zero inflated, otherwise looks normally distibuted
#pca - seems normally distributed but with 3 modes
#latitude-  seems normal
#UVVR mean - right skewed, 0 inflated, outliers on tail



#might need to rescale PCA and latitude to be on a similar degree of magnitude as other variables
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
hist(surv_train$pca)
hist(scale(surv_train$pca,scale=T,center = F))
hist(scale(surv_train$pca,scale=T,center = T))
#try scaling without centering




## 2. Is there collinearity among the covariates?
#-------------------------------------------------------------
#ignored collinearity leads to nothing being significant

# a) plot pairwise scatterplots, (alternatively look at correlation coefficients, or a PCA biplot of all covariates)
PerformanceAnalytics::chart.Correlation(pres_preds, histogram = TRUE, method = "spearman")
#entropy, pca, and ndvi correlated
#also binary high marsh and high marsh proportion


# b) Look at variance inflation factor (larger if the covariate R2 is large, most variation in the covariate is explained by variation in all the other covariates)
# remove variables with the highest VIF until all remaining variable have below a select threshold
# even moderate collinearity can mask weak ecological signals so using a low threshold like 3 or 2 is important.
